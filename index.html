        <p>One important part of Expeditors' business is consolidating freight.  Expeditors arranges the freight of various customers in a way that takes advantage of the weight and volume constraints of the vessel in which the freight is being shipped.  If one customer is shipping bricks and another customer is shipping pillows we can combine the bricks and pillows to minimize the shipping costs of our customers.</p>

<p>Question
Assume every container on a ship can hold 10,000 pounds of freight.  Write a function in Java or Java Script that reads a text file of comma separated numbers where each number represents the weight of an individual piece of freight. Your function should return the number of containers required to ship all of the pieces of freight.</p>

<p>For example, if your function is passed a file containing [4000, 4000, 3000], it should return 2. If your function is passed a file containing [5000, 5000, 4000, 4000, 2000, 10000], it should return 3.</p>
